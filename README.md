# Battleship-ReactJS
A battleship game created using ReactJS.

--------------Current functionality-------------------
1. User can play trying to sink computer's battleships
2. Battleships are static and are rendered dynamically
3. Numerical representation of the battleships (note, the user does not yet know what the numerical values mean)

---------------Desired future functionality---------------------
1. Use colours in place of numbers (e.g. blue for a miss, red for a hit, grey for an untouched square)
2. Render battleship position dynamically (i.e. the battleship positions are different each time the page loads)
3. (big ticket item) Take turns with the computer so the computer can try and sink the user's battleships
  3.1 Create another 10x10 grid for user to place their battleships
  3.2 Computer randomly selects a square to 'hit'
  3.3 User and computer take turns
  3.4 If a player gets a hit they get another turn.  
4. Make it mobile friendly
